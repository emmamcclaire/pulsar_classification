# Pulsar Classification

Pulsars are a type of neutron star that can be detected using radio telescopes, which capture the unique radio signal emitted by the star. However, a bulk of the signals detected are generated by radio interference and noise, making the search for legitimate signals a difficult and time consuming process. This machine learning model can serve as a tool to quickly identify the subset of signals that are associated with what scientists would classify as a "candidate pulsar". 

## The Data

**17,898 Total Observations, 2 Target Classes**
 > 9% Candidate Pulsar Signals (Class 1)  
 > 91% Radio Interference Signals (Class 0)

## Features

The features are derived from two measurements that describe pulsar radio emission:
1. Integrated Profile
2. DM-SNR Curve

Each measurement is described by the following summary statistics for a total of **8 features**:
- Mean
- Standard Deviation
- Kurtosis
- Skewness
